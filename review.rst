Introduction
------------

After the initial development is finished the changes are uploaded to the Staging server for review.
This is carried out by the project manager and designers to spot any inconsistencies between the
assets and the final result. The process to upload changes is outlined in detail in the
:doc:`deployment` section.

It is possible that during this process there will be amends or new features, if that's the case
then the development team will get a list of assets with the requested changes so the :doc:`assets`
and :doc:`development/index` phases will continue as normal until the project is approved.
